# CLIP

List published CLIP methods and repeat the analysis

## How-To

+ Repeat the data of one method  
  - Pick one paper, including Original data, figures, tables  
  - Download the raw data, re-analysis (processing)  
  - Make a report (.md)  
  - Save your code here  


## Progress

  - [ ] HITS-CLIP, high-throughput sequencing CLIP
  - [ ] PAR-CLIP, PhotoActivatable-Ribonucleoside-Enhanced CLIP
  - [ ] iCLIP, individual-nucleotide resolution CLIP
  - [ ] eCLIP, enhanced CLIP
  - [ ] irCLIP, infrared-CLIP
  - [ ] hiCLIP, RNA hybrid and individual-nucleotide resolution CLIP
  - [ ] RICK, RNA interactome using click chemistry
